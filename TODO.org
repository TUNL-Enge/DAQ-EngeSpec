  - [X] Make a test data set P1 and DE
  - [ ] Read data set
  - [ ] Make initial histogram using np.histogram2d 
    - Use pre-dedined 512x512 bins 
  - [ ] Use imshow or pcolormesh to plot

    - All sorting in c++ code
    - Python just plots
* Fitting
  - [ ] Simple net counts
  - [ ] Fitting for gross counts
  - [ ] Reimplement MCMCGaus
    - Note that my R version is actually a minimization + sampling
    - Start my re-implementing that

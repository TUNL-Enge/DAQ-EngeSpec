* Release blocks
  - [ ] 2D histograms
  - [ ] Saving data
    - SpectrumObject has EngeSort object embedded, which shouldn't be
      saved...
    - Split EngeSort out from spectra. Put in a separate sort object?
  - [ ] Scalers
  - [X] Jam-like zooming
  - [ ] Reloading data
  - [ ] Jiggling icons
* Current
  - [X] Separate out sort routines
  - [ ] Fix updating on 2D histograms
  - [X] Color scheme in 2D for small number of counts
  - [ ] 2D z-zooming
  - [ ] Scroll-bars!
  - [ ] SpanSelector outside the spectrum range
  - [ ] Click-to-zoom
  - [ ] Expand tree by default
  - [ ] 1D Gates

* GUI
  - [ ] Some feedback numbers
  - [ ] Grab stuff from MIDAS to display?
* 2D Histograms
  - [X] Color scheme
* Fitting
  - [ ] Reimplement MCMCGaus
    - Note that my R version is actually a minimization + sampling
    - Start my re-implementing that
* Misc
  - [ ] Data frames
    - HDF Data frames?
    - just binary dataframes?

* GUI
  - [ ] Tree to select histograms
  - [ ] Some feedback numbers
  - [ ] Grab stuff from MIDAS to display?
* 2D Histograms
  - [X] Make a test data set P1 and DE
  - [X] Read data set
  - [X] Make initial histogram using np.histogram2d 
    - Use pre-dedined 512x512 bins 
  - [X] Use imshow or pcolormesh to plot
    - https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.histogram2d.html
    - Apparently imshow updates better

  - [ ] Check updates
    - Scaling buttons don't work well

  - [ ] Color scheme
  
* Interface with c++
  - [ ] Learn how to add data to arrays through c++
  - [ ] Learn how to pass gates to c++
    - All sorting in c++ code
    - Python just plots
* Fitting
  - [ ] Simple net counts
  - [ ] Fitting for gross counts
  - [ ] Reimplement MCMCGaus
    - Note that my R version is actually a minimization + sampling
    - Start my re-implementing that
* Misc
  - [ ] Data frames
    - HDF Data frames?
    - just binary dataframes?

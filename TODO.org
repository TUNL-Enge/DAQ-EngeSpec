* Current
  - [X] Zero histograms button (A.fill(0))
  - [X] Run simulations in background with threads and delays
    - Button to start and stop
  - [ ] Better window scaling
  - [X] 2D zooming better
  - [ ] SpanSelector outside the spectrum range
  - [X] Remember zooming properties of spectra
  - [X] Draw gate on 2D histogram if set
  - [ ] Expand tree by default
  - [ ] Only draw gate when clicked in tree
  - [ ] 1D Gates
  - [ ] Why do the OutLog functions crash with simulations? 
* GUI
  - [X] Tree to select histograms
  - [ ] Some feedback numbers
  - [ ] Grab stuff from MIDAS to display?
* 2D Histograms
  - [X] Make a test data set P1 and DE
  - [X] Read data set
  - [X] Make initial histogram using np.histogram2d 
    - Use pre-dedined 512x512 bins 
  - [X] Use imshow or pcolormesh to plot
    - https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.histogram2d.html
    - Apparently imshow updates better
      https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15992149/how-to-update-pcolor-in-matplotlib
  - [X] Check updates
    - Scaling buttons don't work well
    - Update button doesn't work
  - [ ] Color scheme
  
* Interface with c++
  - [X] Learn how to add data to arrays through c++
  - [X] 2D arrays?
  - [X] Interrupt simulation once running?
  - [X] Learn how to pass gates to c++
    - All sorting in c++ code
    - Python just plots
* Fitting
  - [ ] Simple net counts
  - [ ] Fitting for gross counts
  - [ ] Reimplement MCMCGaus
    - Note that my R version is actually a minimization + sampling
    - Start my re-implementing that
* Misc
  - [ ] Data frames
    - HDF Data frames?
    - just binary dataframes?

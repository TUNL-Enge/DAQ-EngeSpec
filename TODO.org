* Release blocks
  - [X] 2D histograms
  - [X] Saving data
    - SpectrumObject has EngeSort object embedded, which shouldn't be
      saved...
    - Split EngeSort out from spectra. Put in a separate sort object?
  - [X] Jam-like zooming
  - [X] Reloading data
  - [X] Jiggling icons
  - [ ] Scalers
  - [X] segfault on exit
* Current
  - [X] Separate out sort routines
  - [X] Fix updating on 2D histograms
  - [X] Color scheme in 2D for small number of counts
  - [X] 2D z-zooming
  - [X] Scroll-bars!
  - [X] Scroll-bars in 2D
  - [X] SpanSelector outside the spectrum range
  - [X] Click-to-zoom
  - [X] HiDPI scaling
  - [X] Expand tree by default
  - [X] Spectra list width
  - [ ] replace curve_fit with lmfit for fitting spectra
  - [ ] 1D Gates
  - [ ] Scaler display
  - [ ] More than one gate per histogram
  - [ ] Arbitrary 2D histogram size
  - [ ] OutLog fixes with threads?
* GUI
  - [ ] Some feedback numbers
  - [ ] Grab stuff from MIDAS to display?
  - [ ] List of files being sorted
* 2D Histograms
  - [X] Color scheme
* Fitting
  - [ ] Reimplement MCMCGaus
    - Note that my R version is actually a minimization + sampling
    - Start by re-implementing that
* Misc
  - [X] Data frames
    - Using pickle files
    - HDF Data frames?
    - just binary dataframes?
